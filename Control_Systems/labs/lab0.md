1. Comparison of open and loop control in speed control of DC motor and to find
   the transfer function.
2. To study the characteristics of positional error detector by angular
   displacement of two servopotentiometers:
   	a. exited with dc
	b. exited with ac
3. To study synchro transmitter in terms of position v/s phase and voltage
   mangitude with respect to rotor voltage mangitude/ phase
4. To study remote position indicator systems using sychro transmitter/
   reciver.
5. To plot speed-torque curves for ac servometer for different voltages
6. To study ac motor position control systems and to plot the dynamic response
   and calculate peak time, settling time, peak overshoot, damping frequency
   and stead state error.
7. To study the time response of simulated linear systems.
8. To study the performance of PID Controller.
9. To study the performance, unit step response, unit ramp response of any 2nd order transfer function on same graph using MATLAB.
10. To draw the magnetization (Volt Amps) characteristic of saturable core
    reactor used in the magnetic amplifier circuits.
