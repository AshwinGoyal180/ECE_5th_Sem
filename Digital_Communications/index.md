# Digital Communication

- Direct Extension to Anolog Communication
- Base form of Data is changed

## Digital Systems

- Morse Code
- Telegram
- Mobile Network
- Satellite Communication
- DSP
- DTH

## Why Digitize

- Easier Date Recording and Storage
- Lesser Effect of distortion, noise or interference
- Digital Circuits are cheaper to design and have a much more flexible
  hardware implementaion
  	- MOSFETS
	- based upon on basic ideas of MOSFETS
	- cheaper than BJTs
	- flexible means scalable, can scaled up or down
- Signal processing is much more convenient
	-  ready for transmitter and reconstructing
	- analog domain had a difficult approach, lot of equipment is req
	- digital domain is easier
- Data encryption and security is much easier
	- cryptography is scrabling of data, can be decoded by known person
	- source coding and channel coding
	- Information Theroy and Coding ITC
	-
- Time division multiplexing in digital systems is much easier to
  implement than FDM
  	- used in analog, took frequency spectra and acc used it to transmit
	- TDM is easier, frame are used
	- if in the same time slot, multiple signals can be sent parallely
	  using electronic switches
- information channel capacity is much better utilized by digital signals
	- used by digital signals ITC
	- channel capacity: in transmission media, certain amount of data can
	  be transmitted, in digital communication bits are used
-  high fidelity transmission since regrenrative repatin is possible
	-  ability of reciever to regenrate signal exact replica of orignal
	   message signal
	- high fid means accuracy of replica is high
	- repeater captures the signal, amplify its and sends
	- reg repeater have equipment that recieves the info, understands the
	  info and regenrates the sequence and sends it
	- noise will be less and fidelity will be high

over 20 yrs lot of has changed, from pentium to core to i7 to threadripper
then came GPUs order of trillion of FLOPs

Processing tech evolved with evolution of hardware, that came with
scalability.

Digital Ciruitry is flexible than Analog.

Linear Signal Processing has become easier.

- Cross Talk (interference) is less in Digital Communication
- Analog communication constantly changes
- Digital Sequence changes only when required. Sampling Process
