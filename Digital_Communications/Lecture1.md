## Source Coding

## Channel coding

Parity set of data that adheres to certain rules.
Data could be corrupted, parity bits helps in data recovery.

Next Step

## line coding

Line means channel, message needs to be in form of electrical waveform
There are various methods.
To be done before data is sent.
Over large areas, data needs to be band pass modulated, PM is relevant in
Digital communication, over high frequency, quine process. May or not be
applied.

## Digital Reovery

Logical information

Remove the parity
unscrable the data

reconvert to analog from digital.
