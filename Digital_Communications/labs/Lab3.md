### Aim:

**Delta Modulation**

Extension of Differential Code Modualation.

1. increasing sampling rate, due to inverse rule, value of delta wil l be
   decrease i.e. that data caputre is much cleaner, hence bandwidth
   increases. performance will be affected the snr will be directly affected i.e it will be much better by sqaure law, but bandwith overutilization.
2. it also uses differential quantization. single bit quantization, and time based delay is used to estimate and no prediction systems is uses.
3. Repeating 01 slope overload
4. ADM: depending on 01, ADM is control mechanism that changes the step size of quantizer.
5. snr
