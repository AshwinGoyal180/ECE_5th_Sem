	Effective communication has been the backbone of strong relationships,
be it political, corporate or any other field. It is the first step in
forging ways that lead to trustworthy client relationships. Its
importance has been amplified by the current scenario. The corporate
world is on the precipice of change in the way it handles and manages
situations and also what they stand for. Therefore, effective
communication skills are becoming a must, more than they are already.

Focussing on a few of these skills viz. pronunciation, phonemic
awareness and fine motor skills, it is intended to identify the
different aspects of it, along with the concerns and problems that
people face in these areas. Also, ways to overcome these problems are
examined in order to be a better communicator.
