\begin{abstract}
	Semiconductors and microprocessors are essential to modern technology;
	their absence would halt every aspect of modern life. Advances and improvements
	in the semiconductor industry have fueled the technological revolution of the
	1990s. The decrease in the cost and size of transistors allowed for an every
	increasing amount of transistors to be put onto a silicon chip, thereby allowing
	for faster processors.
	The ability to fit more transistors on a silicon wafer approximately follows
	Moore’s Law, which is named after Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel Corporation.
	Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors on a silicon chip doubles every 18-24 months.
