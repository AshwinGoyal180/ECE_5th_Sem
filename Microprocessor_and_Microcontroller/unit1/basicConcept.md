# Evolution of Microcontroller and Microporcessor

## Evolution of 8085

First Microprocessor 4004, 4bit microprocess, PMOS microprocessor

4bit is the word length of instruction

Second 4040, manufactured by intel, 1971

8008, 1972, 8bit Microprocessor, PMOS.

8080, 1973, NMOS, 8bit Microprocessor.
	- drawback
	- needed 3 power supply


## 8085

- 1975
- need only one power supply
	- 5v in

## 8086
- 16 bit processor
- 1982


## Difference Between Microcontroller and Microprocessor

- Microprocessor is the brain of any computer
	- computer is a system that processes the information provided by the
	  user
	  - analog and digital computer
	  - analog computer accuracy is less
	  - digital computer accuracy is more
	  - circuit parameters: offstate, tolerance of resistors, voltage and many more
	    and hence not accurate
	  - digital computer doesn't depend on circuit parameters
- Microprocessor - silicon chip which includes ALU
- Microcontroller - single package

## types of digital Computers

- size
- processing
- complexity
- speed
- word lenght


- mainframe
	- high speed
	- high capacity
	- word lenght is high 32 to 64 bit
	- it contains 2 or more central processing unit
	- each is implemented using individual chips
	- used for scientific applications
- mini
	-  data storage capacity is mod
	-  varies from 16 to 32 bit
	- one central processing unit
	- implementation requires more chips
- micro
	- data storage capacity is less
	- varies between processor
	- single chip and processor
	- single chip devices are called micro computer
