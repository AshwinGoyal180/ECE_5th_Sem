## Model Analysis

![Model Analysis](img/Model_analysis.png)

- particular library designated as working library with logical name WORK.
  (compiles descriptions in this file)
- Items compiled in one design library can be imported into design units
  compiled in different design library by using library and use clause


## Simulation:

- Elaboration Phase:
	- hierachy linking
	- storage allocation
- Initialization Phase:
	- assign values to implicit signals
	- effective values are computed ofr explicitly declared signals

## VHDL environment

![VHDL Envrironment](img/VHDL_env.png)

- Analyzer is responsible for lexical analysis and syntax check
- Design enviroment take care of creating and deleting packages
- Simulation report is made by Environment

## Simulation

![Hardware Simulation](img/simulation.png)

**Simulation is an act of excercisign a model of an actualcomponents for
analyzing its coduct under a given set of condition and/or stimuli**

- Simulation engine may be calpable of producing detailed timing and ablaog
  voltages or it may be able to produce high level function information.
